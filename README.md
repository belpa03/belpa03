# 👋 Hi there!

I recently recreated my GitHub account to better organize my projects and learning journey.

This GitHub space is used to document my growth, learning process, and hands-on experience, especially in data-related fields.

### What you’ll find here:
- Data analytics & data science projects  
- Python, SQL, and data visualization practices  
- Mini projects, case studies, and experiments  

This repository serves as a personal portfolio and learning log as I continue to develop my analytical and problem-solving skills.

Thanks for visiting!
